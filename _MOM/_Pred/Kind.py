### «text» ### start of documentation
__doc__ = """

    :class:`Kind` is the root class of a hierarchy of classes defining the
    various kinds of predicates of essential classes. The predicate kind
    controls how a predicate is evaluated. Technically, `Kind` and its
    subclasses define Python `property` types.

    The kind of a concrete predicate is specified as one the properties of
    the :mod:`predicate's type<_MOM._Pred.Type>`. The kind
    class gets instantiated by :class:`~_MOM._Pred.Spec.Spec` which passes
    the `type` to the kind's `__init__`.

    This module provides five kinds of predicates: :class:`Object`,
    :class:`Object_Init`, :class:`Region`, :class:`System`, and
    :class:`Uniqueness`. A specific application or application domain can
    define additional kinds of predicates by providing additional classes
    derived from :class:`Kind`.
