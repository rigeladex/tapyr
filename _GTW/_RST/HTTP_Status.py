            If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other
            than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect
            the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this
            might change the conditions under which the request was issued.

              Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not
              allowed to change the method on the redirected request.
              However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as
              if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location
              field-value regardless of the original request method. The
              status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish
              to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected
              of the client.

            http://insanecoding.blogspot.co.at/2014/02/http-308-incompetence-expected.html::

              Since 302 was being used in two different ways, two new codes
              were created, one for each technique, to ensure proper use in
              the future. 302 retained its definition, but with so many
              incorrect implementations out there, 302 should essentially
              never be used if you want to ensure correct semantics are
              followed, instead use 303 - See Other (processing, move on...),
              or 307 Temporary Redirect (The real version of 302).

              In all my experience working with HTTP over the past decade,
              I've found 301, 303, and 307 to be implemented and used
              correctly as defined in HTTP v1.1, with 302 still being used
              incorrectly as 303 (instead of 307 semantics), generally by PHP
              programmers. But as above, never use 302, as who knows what the
              browser will do with it.

              Since existing practice today is that 301, 303, and 307 are
              used correctly pretty much everywhere, if someone misuses it,
              they should be told to correct their usage or handling. 302 is
              still so misused till this day, it's a lost cause.
